## Project description


The URL of this app: http://165.227.22.37:8080/


### Background


This web application is designed to provide a course searching engine for A&M students, especially for the graduate students in the department of CSE. Normally, the section information for previous semesters, such as instructor, average GPA, etc. can be obtained on A&M registar report. However, it's inconvenient for us students to use, since it's organized by semester. If we want to check a course for last 3 years, we would need to download 9 PDF reports and search that course in each of them. It's not straightforward if we want to compare the results across different semesters. To solve this problem, this web app collect all course catalog data and section report data and stored them in database. It will show the information organized by each courses. It's easy to compare section information across different semesters , thus to help students choose the right course section for them. Meanwhile, students can search courses not only with the course ID or name, but also based on their degree programs.
